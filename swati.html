        <h1>MY FEELING FOR HER</h1>
        <P1><B><BR>:> Being with her feels like coming home. She makes ordinary moments special just by being there. Her
                smile lights up my world, and her laugh is my favorite sound. I admire her strength, her kindness, and
                the way
                shesees the best in people—especially me. Every day with her feels like a gift.</BR>
                <BR>:> She’s all I think about.When she walks into a room, my heart races. There’s a fire in the way I
                love
                her—something fierce and unstoppable. She challenges me, excites me, and makes me feel alive in a way no
                one else ever
                has.</BR>
                <BR>:> With her, I feel completely at peace. She understands me in a way no one else does. It’s
                not just about romance—it’s about how safe, valued, and truly seen she makes me feel. I want to grow
                with her, support
                her, and love her through every chapter of life.</BR>
                <br>:> I don’t have all the words yet, but she makes me feel things I’ve never felt before. When I’m
                with
                her, everything just… fits. I want to be better for
                her, to make her happy, and to keep discovering what this connection between us really is.</br>

        <h1><b>WHY HER</b></h1>
        <p1><b>:> Why her? It's that feeling, you know? Like a quiet hum in your chest that just says, "Yeah, this is
                right." She truly gets you, even the messy bits you hide from everyone else, and sees the person you're
                striving to be. With her, you're not just some guy navigating life; you're home, a place where you can
                finally just be.</b></p1>
